    <p style="font-family :'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; background-color:yellow; font-weight: 200px; word-spacing: 10px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 25px;">No-code application development has helped many bridge the digital divide. Enterprises, irrespective of their size and resources can now develop advanced business applications and digitize themselves to meet the growing demands in an ever-evolving industry. Traditional app development was considered the forte of large-scale enterprises with abundant resources and technical expertise. This enabled them to invest heavily in it, something that smaller enterprises couldnâ€™t.

To be able to cater to a larger audience, smaller enterprises turned to no-code application development that allowed them to offer their products and services over the internet. With the help of no-code app development, new opportunities have opened for small and medium scale businesses who can now create dynamic business applications to suit their needs and requirements, without having to write a single line of code. </p>

Using intuitive platforms with drag and drop editors, anyone can easily create an application without having to depend on developers or IT professionals. 

No-code app development has facilitated rapid digitization across industries, with more and more enterprises digitizing themselves using this technology. While no-code is mostly directed towards businesses so that they can build business-strategic applications and create an online presence for themselves, other individuals can also use these platforms to build suitable applications that meet their needs and requirements. </p>
